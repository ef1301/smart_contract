## Purpose of Contract:

When renting an apartment, it is important to ensure that both the renter and rentee keep their ends of the relationship. It is especially important to receive payments in a quick and timely manner when it is due, which is automatically done in this contract by having owners receive payments (monthly rent, security deposits, etc.) from their tenants. This contract has some helpful features for both the owner and tenants relationship. For example, the tenants can request to leave, change tenantship, and pay rental fees. An owner can add a tenant, remove a tenant, and request the tenant to pay rental fees. With so many important payment deadlines to be aware of, a smart contract will ensure the security and efficiency in renting apartments/condos.

# Supply Chain Smart Contract

## Purpose of Contract
To ensure that inventory/products are kept track of before production and distribution to consumers and retailers (from suppliers to the manufacturers), it is important that everything is kept inventory of and that products are produced and passed off to each supply chain body in a timely manner. Consequently, the focus of this smart contract is to secure this portion of the supply chain cycle. In this, we have suppliers and manufacturers.

In short, this contract is in the realm of supply chain smart contracts, but it will be limited to the relationship between suppliers that are delivering and charging for certain products and manufacturers that will be paying for the shipments and keeping track of their own inventory.
