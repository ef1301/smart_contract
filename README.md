Purpose of Contract:
With buying a home, buyers have certain requirements that they must meet to prove their eligibility and ability to purchase a home. Some of these qualities may include being employed for at least 2 years, having a solid income, minimal debt, credit scores, and putting down a favorable down payment. With so many qualities to be aware of, a smart contract will ensure that potential or interested buyers meet seller expectations/requirements.
